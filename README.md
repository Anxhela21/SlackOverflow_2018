# Analysis of Stack Overflow's Annual Developer's Data (2011- 2019)

Exploratory analysis on Stack Overflow's Annual Developer Survey data. 
Along with a dive into the data, this repo includes a regression model built and trained to predict the most popular 
programming language of the following year based on the top languages of past years with good accuracy. 

For more info, I wrote a Medium post on comparing the 2018 and 2019 data, focusing on the rises and falls in the trends of programming languages and corresponding web frameworks.
